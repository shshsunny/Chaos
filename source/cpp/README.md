# Chaos C++ code repository

The published C++ versions of Chaos Emulator. The C++ implementation depends on a graphic lib call EGE (Easy Graphics Engine). In order to manage the project conveniently, I used Dev-C++ as the IDE. You can find the EGE configuration instructions for Dev-C++ (in Chinese) [here](https://xege.org/beginner-lesson-1.html). The first versions are for test. However, if you'd like to try them, you can download the releases directly.
